## How to build

Required tools : [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you didn't download the source code manually, you may clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Semphriss/supertux.semphris.com.git
$ cd supertux.semphris.com
```

Once you have a copy of the source code, navigate to the root folder (the one which contains README.md), then run:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Then you can start the server with this command:
```sh
$ npm start
```
